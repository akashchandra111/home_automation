# home_automation

Final year project.
This project focuses to control home devices using web interface and a telegram bot.

Pre-requisite:
1. python-telegram-bot
2. flask
3. flask-bootstrap

You can install them by using python 'pip':
  For example: 
    pip install python-telegram-bot
    
First enter your bot token in the 'Enter bot token here' placeholder, however that file is still incomplete
I would recommend you to use web framework only which has only one feature missing currently which is to add new device which will be added soon.
You can run that file by typing following command:
./webui.py
